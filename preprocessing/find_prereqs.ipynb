Our readings will be selected from English, French, Portuguese and Spanish-language traditions. And we will pay close attention to genres of prose fiction (Conrad, Cond&eacute;, Olinto), epic and prose poetry (C&eacute;saire, Walcott), theoretical reflection (Gilroy, Glissant, Mudimbe, Benitez-Rojo), and literary autobiography (Barack Obama, Saidiya Hartman).

      "2011-2012 CS 231B (Formerly 223C) More than one-third of the brain is engaged in visual processing, the most sophisticated human sensory system. Yet visual recognition technology has fundamentally influenced our lives on the same scale and scope as text-based technology has, thanks to Google, Twitter, Facebook, etc. This course is designed for those students who are interested in cutting edge computer vision research, and/or are aspiring to be an entrepreneur using vision technology. Course will guide students through the design and implementation of three core vision technologies: segmentation, detection and classification on three highly practical, real-world problems. Course will focus on teaching the fundamental theory, detailed algorithms, practical engineering insights, and guide them to develop state-of-the-art systems evaluated based on the most modern and standard benchmark datasets. Prerequisites: CS2223B or equivalent and a good machine learning background (i.e. CS221, CS228, CS229). Fluency in Matlab and C/C++. \n",

This course focuses on the foundational concepts that drive these applications.  In short, AI is the mathematics of making good decisions given incomplete information (hence the need for probability) and limited computation (hence the need for algorithms).  Specific topics include search, constraint satisfaction, game playing, Markov decision processes, graphical models, machine learning, and logic.
