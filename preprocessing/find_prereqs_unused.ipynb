      "Given the importance of art to all aspects of their lives, the Greeks had reason to respect their artists. Yet potters, painters and even sculptors possessed little social standing. nn nnWhy did the Greeks value the work of craftsmen but not the men themselves? Why did Herodotus dismiss those who worked with their hands as &quot;mechanics?&quot; What prompted Homer to claim that &quot;there is no greater glory for a man&iquest; than what he achieves with his own hands,&quot; provided that he was throwing a discus and not a vase on a wheel?nn nnPainted pottery was essential to the religious and secular lives of the Greeks. Libations to the gods and to the dead required vases from which to pour them. Economic prosperity depended on the export of wine and oil in durable clay containers. At home, depictions of gods and heroes on vases reinforced Greek values and helped parents to educate their children. Ceramic sets with scenes of Dionysian excess were reserved for elite symposia from which those who potted and painted them were excluded.nn nnSculptors were less lowly but even those who carved the Parthenon were still regarded as &quot;mechanics,&quot; with soft bodies and soft minds (Xenophon) &quot;indifferent to higher things&quot; (Plutarch).nn nnThe seminar addresses these issues. Students will read and discuss texts, write response papers and present slide lectures and gallery talks on aspects of the artist's profession. \n",

Marketing is key to the success of an organization and requires an ability to design and execute a coherent strategy across a number of different dimensions. Specifically, we study in depth each of the tactical P's - price, promotion, product, and place (distribution) - and do so through the structural lens of the three C's - customer, competition, and company, with a particular focus on the customer. Going beyond the fundamentals, the course emphasizes two specific areas of specialization and learning throughout. First, it focuses on data-driven techniques for assessing markets and teaches you which of these techniques apply to different marketing decision problems. Second, the course takes seriously the idea that consumers often want different things. It therefore focuses on how you can generate company value by understanding and serving heterogeneous consumer wants and needs. \n",

      "The September 2017 issue of Interview Magazine features Kim Kardashian West dressed as Jackie Kennedy on the cover, along with her daughter, North. In the article, the magazine calls Kardashian West's popular reality show, a rooted-in-real life mirror to what the American family looks like today, bringing up topics such as race, gender, and more recently, trans identity. As early as 50 years ago, it would have been nearly impossible for a magazine to feature a white woman, especially one as notorious as Kim Kardashian, on its cover with her biracial, black daughter. So how did the mirror of the American Family change from the Mad Men ideal of a white, wealthy, suburban, nuclear family to a sprawling mega-family who document every moment of their lives for television screens? And is it even accurate to call the Kardashians the mirror? Who is left out of this reflection? nnIn this class, we will explore how representations of American families reflect shifting trends on the national level, including increasingly nuanced understandings of race, gender, sexuality, and citizenship. Through engagements with various texts (television, films, articles, advertisements) we will practice making nuanced written arguments about the rhetoric of families as we work toward the final assignment, a research-based argument. We will analyze several topics in class to develop and improve analytic and argumentative writing skills, from debates over LGBTQ+ parenting to mixed race families and generational conflicts while asking, what makes a family? Which aspects of families are represented as ideal? And what do those ideals say about issues beyond the family? \n",

      "2011-2012 CS 231B (Formerly 223C) More than one-third of the brain is engaged in visual processing, the most sophisticated human sensory system. Yet visual recognition technology has fundamentally influenced our lives on the same scale and scope as text-based technology has, thanks to Google, Twitter, Facebook, etc. This course is designed for those students who are interested in cutting edge computer vision research, and/or are aspiring to be an entrepreneur using vision technology. Course will guide students through the design and implementation of three core vision technologies: segmentation, detection and classification on three highly practical, real-world problems. Course will focus on teaching the fundamental theory, detailed algorithms, practical engineering insights, and guide them to develop state-of-the-art systems evaluated based on the most modern and standard benchmark datasets. Prerequisites: CS2223B or equivalent and a good machine learning background (i.e. CS221, CS228, CS229). Fluency in Matlab and C/C++. \n",

This course focuses on the foundational concepts that drive these applications.  In short, AI is the mathematics of making good decisions given incomplete information (hence the need for probability) and limited computation (hence the need for algorithms).  Specific topics include search, constraint satisfaction, game playing, Markov decision processes, graphical models, machine learning, and logic.
