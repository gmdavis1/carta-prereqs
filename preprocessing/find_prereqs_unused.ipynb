This course will examine the development of nuclear technology and its consequences to politics and culture at the global, national, regional and local levels from interdisciplinary perspectives. Some of the key questions addressed are: How did different countries and communities experience and respond to the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki? How did such experiences affect the later development of the technology in different national contexts? How have nuclear tests and disasters change the ways in which risks are understood and managed globally and locally? What kinds of political activism, international arrangements, and cultural tropes and imageries emerged in response to nuclear technology? We explore these questions through key works and recent studies in history, anthropology, sociology, and science and technology studies, as well as through films and literature. \n",

      "In this course, we explore the world of words: their creation, evolution, borrowing, change, and death. Words are the key to understanding the culture and ideas of a people, and by tracing the biographies of words we are able to discern how the world was, is, and might be perceived and described. We trace how words are formed, and how they change in pronunciation, spelling, meaning, and usage over time. How does a word get into the dictionary? What do words reveal about status, class, region, and race? How is the language of men and women critiqued differently within our society? How does slang evolve? How do languages become endangered or die, and what is lost when they do? We will visit the Facebook Content Strategy Team and learn more about the role words play in shaping our online experiences. Together, the class will collect Stanford language and redesign the digital dictionary of the future. Trigger Warning: Some of the subject matter of this course is sensitive and may cause offense.

      "This course's goal is to critically engage students in the socioeconomic and racial disparities in healthcare outcomes and encourage students to think broadly about the complex relationship between institutions, healthcare providers, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity. The topics will center on conceptual issues important for understanding how socioeconomic and minority status can lead to poor health outcomes examining how conscious and unconscious institutional biases affect treatment, care, and access, and addressing proposals for how to reduce disparities in health care. nThe focus of the course is broad. The first three weeks will center on public health issues due to global healthcare trends, including the results of disparities in the United States. These discussions will frame our sessions int he latter sic weeks, which will each consist of a case study of specific cases of disparities and response to such inequities worldwide, from India to Rwanda. nEach class's discussion will be guided by case studies. The readings will come from a variety of sources, including academic journals, more popular journals and magazines, books and government documents. Student will be expected to complete the readings and a reflection in advance of class each week. Each week will additionally include optional readings that will guide additional discussion. \n",

      "The period between the 1820s and the 1860s has traditionally been called the &quot;American Renaissance&quot;: a time when the U.S. nation, and its literature, flourished. The nineteenth century witnessed the publication of a number of important American texts that gave rise to a new national literary tradition, including familiar titles like The Scarlet Letter, Moby-Dick, and Leaves of Grass. Yet, as the nation stretched its geographical coordinates, writers from outside of this predominantly white, male literary heritage issued their own responses to the vision of a &quot;New World Democracy.&quot; This course surveys and contextualizes these responses. Reading authors from Native American, Latino/a, African American, and French creole cultures, we'll expand our study of American literature to include writers who interrogate the project of American Democracy from both within and outside of the nation. While analyzing autobiographies, poems, short stories, and speeches we will also learn to read paintings, Native American sign systems, and newspaper sketches, in an exploration of what it meant to be &quot;American&quot; and what counted as &quot;Literature&quot; in the golden era of American Letters. \n",

      "We sometimes think we should do something just because it will benefit us in the future, even though we don&iquest;t particularly feel like doing it now (e.g. we exercise, go to the dentist for a check-up, or set aside money for retirement).  And we sometimes think we should do something for the sake of another person, even when it is inconvenient, costly, or unpleasant (e.g. we stop to help a stranded motorist, donate to charity, or tell someone an embarrassing truth rather than a face-saving lie).  When we do the former, we act prudently.  When we do the latter, we act morally.  This course explores the debate among philosophers about the source of our reasons for acting prudently and morally.  Some argue that our reasons to be prudent and moral stem directly from the fact that we are rational &iquest; that it is contrary to reason to ignore our own future interests, or the interests of other people.  Others disagree, arguing that the source of these reasons must lie elsewhere.

      "What is authoritarianism?  What is the authoritarian personality?  In what social, psychological, economic, and political climates does authoritarianism take root and become an object of desire?  In what ways does the rule of law bend to and even reflect authoritarian impulses?  Although it is common to think of constitutionalism as anti-authoritarian, and of authoritarianism as anathema to constitutionalism (after all, what do formal legal &quot;constraints&quot; on state power inscribed in fundamental law mean in an authoritarian state -- a state free to act as it wishes?), in what ways and to what ends have authoritarian and quasi-authoritarian regimes relied on constitutional law and in what ways do authoritarian impulses manifest in supposedly liberal democratic regimes?  Finally, and crucially for our purposes, what roles have lawyers played in erecting and resisting authoritarianism?

The course will consider how authorized narratives feature in the built environment and in the social spaces and usage of the city and how unauthorized, sometimes contentious narratives lurk beneath the surface and persist on the &quot;skin&quot; of the city. It will investigate the role of artists and the arts in &quot;mapping&quot; or surfacing alternative stories, concepts and imaginations of how the city is or can be. Inspired by the writings of Michel DeCerteau and Italo Calvino, this class explores the role of narrative in the city and the imagination from the perspective of cultural memory, lived experience, usage of space and organization of the built infrastructure. It offers an alternative approach to thinking about cities, how they are formed and how they function. This class will utilize and combine active field research methods with creative practice. Locations for our field research and excursions will include areas around Stanford and the Bay Area. The class will function as a hybrid seminar and collaborative studio workspace supporting students interested in applying creative practices to field research to develop methods for materializing narratives in various forms of public performance or place-specific art.

We will also consider the resistance to such attempts to elicit shock-and-awe through artistic patronage. By studying music, architecture, garden design, the visual arts, and theater together, students will gain a new perspective on works of art in their political contexts.

      "The concept of &quot;tyranny of scales&quot; in natural/engineered porous media refers to the disparity of temporal and spatial scales at which mass, momentum, and energy transport is best understood and at which predictions are needed for practical applications. Modeling approaches that incorporate process understanding at different temporal and spatial scales are often necessary to improve our predictive capabilities of natural and engineered porous media.nThe course focuses on the fundamental understanding of multiscale systems and corresponding modeling tools to analyze them. \n",

      "The class begins with the art, architecture and political ideals of Periclean Athens, from the emergence of the city as the political and cultural center of Greece in 450 to its defeat in the Peloponnesian War in 404.  It then considers how Athens and the rest of Greece proceed in the fourth century to rebuild their lives and the monuments that define them.  Earlier artistic traditions endure, with subtle changes, in the work of sculptors such as Kephisodotos.  Less subtle are the outlook and output of his son Praxiteles.  In collaboration with Phryne, his muse and mistress, Praxiteles challenged the canons and constraints of the past with the first female nude in the history of Greek sculpture.  His gender-bending depictions of gods and men were equally audacious, their shiny surfaces reflecting Plato&iquest;s discussion of Eros and androgyny.  Scopas was also a man of his time but pursued different interests.  Drawn to the inner lives of men and woman, his tormented Trojan War heroes and victims are still scarred by memories of the Peloponnesian War, and a world away from the serene faces of the Parthenon.  His famous Maenad, a devotee of Dionysos who has left this world for another, belongs to the same years as Euripides' Bacchae and, at the same time, anticipates the torsion and turbulence of Bernini and the Italian Baroque.  In the work of these and other fourth century personalities, the stage is set for Alexander the Great and his conquest of a kingdom extending from Greece to the Indus River.
